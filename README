This project consists of a simple Publish-Subscribe server
written in Python, along with accompanying tests.

The simplest way to run the server is to first install
using setuptools:

    cd pypublishsubscribe
    python setup.py install

You can then run the server by cd'ing again into the nested
"pypublishsubscribe" directory and calling:

    python -m publishsubscribeserver <port_number>

specifying the port number you wish the server to listen on.
When the server launches successfully you will be shown the
message:

    Starting server. Listening on <port_number>....

Associated tests can be run using "nose", by calling anywhere
in the project directory:

    nosetests
